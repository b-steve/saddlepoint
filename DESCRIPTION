Description: This package provides a comprehensive framework for performing operations 
    on Cumulant Generating Functions (CGF) and efficiently computing saddlepoint 
    approximation-related functions in statistical modeling. It enables users to 
    manage various operations on random variables through their CGFs and to compute 
    saddlepoint-based maximum likelihood estimates.    Additionally, the package effectively handles constraints in optimization 
    problems and offers integration with C++ for accurate and efficient gradient 
    computations. Its design allows for extensibility, accommodating user-defined 
    CGFs and operations.    This package is particularly useful for statisticians and data scientists who 
    work with random variables whose probability distribution functions are 
    computationally intractable. It streamlines the process of handling these 
    variables, making the analysis more accessible and manageable.
