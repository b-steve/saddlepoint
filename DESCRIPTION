Description: This package provides a comprehensive framework for performing operations 
    on Cumulant Generating Functions (CGF) and efficiently computing saddlepoint 
    approximation-related functions for statistical modeling. It enables users to 
    manage various operations on random variables through their CGFs and to compute 
    saddlepoint-based maximum likelihood estimates.
